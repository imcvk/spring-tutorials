# The prototype scope

If the scope is set to prototype, the Spring IoC container creates a new bean instance of the object every time a request for that specific bean is made. As a rule, use the prototype scope for all state-full beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans.

To define a prototype scope, you can set the scope property to prototype in the bean configuration file, as shown in the following code snippet âˆ’
```
<!-- A bean definition with prototype scope -->
<bean id = "..." class = "..." scope = "prototype">
   <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
</bean>

```
